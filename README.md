# 🧭 Data Storytelling – Analysing Survival on the Titanic

---

## 🚢 Project Overview

### **Project Objective:**

1. Perform an in-depth analysis of passenger survival on the Titanic using Python.
2. Use **data storytelling** to uncover patterns and relationships in survival rates through visual exploration and statistics.

### **Purpose of the Analysis:**

Transform raw passenger data into meaningful insights that explain *why* certain people survived while others didn’t — connecting data with human stories.

### **Importance of Data Storytelling:**

Beyond mere numbers, this project demonstrates how analytical storytelling helps reveal the impact of demographics, socio-economic factors, and travel class on survival.

### **Role of the Project:**

Combine data cleaning, exploration, and visualization techniques to deliver an insightful, visually engaging narrative around one of history’s most studied datasets.
